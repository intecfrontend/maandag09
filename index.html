I am just enrolling into SASS just as you (stable release 3.5.6 is only 17 months old) but this is better than CSS
for many reasons.

No installation with NPM package install, easier way...    
    
install live sass extention, make an index and it's css add an scss file.
Make sure the prettier doesn't go away and it must say watching.
CSS the body and translate it into scss, make sure it sais watching at the bottom
now we will use variables dor css custom properties.

$mycolor : gold in scss and ... so if we change the color there is a common place to find it ONCE

we can as well create a sass-map which looks like an objec but maps the colors of your site
